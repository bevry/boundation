# History

## v1.84.0 2023 November 17

-   Use the new `@bevry/fs-*` dependencies
-   Rename `browsers` question to `browsersTargeted` to not conflate it with the `browser` option

## v1.83.0 2023 November 16

-   use `node:` prefix on builtins as our min supported node version supports it
-   consistently order imports
-   base:
    -   for fetching, instead of `master` use `HEAD` (evolutes to the default branch)
    -   if a bevry organisation:
        -   output `SECURITY.md`
        -   add tidelift to `FUNDING.yml` if publishing to npm
-   ci:
    -   remove macos and windows ci tests for now, was causing too much overload with dependabot
    -   update `bevry-actions/npm` version
    -   include automerge into `bevry.yml` as per github recommendation, rather than as its own third party workflow
    -   have dependabot also update github action packages
    -   have dependabot only update on sunday on midnight in perth time (so it doesn't overload @balupton's work schedule)
    -   only allow security dependabot requests, as boundation handles the dep updates, and the dep updates overwhelm github
-   fs:
    -   instead of exec'ing `rm -rf`, use builtin recursive remove now that our min supported node supports it
    -   better handling of poor internet connection and invalid caching
-   git:
    -   correctly name `getGitActiveDefaultBranch` to `getGitActiveBranch`
-   questions/runtime:
    -   **introduced target versions, instead of using supported/test versions, to ensure that `expandNodeVersions`` works correctly**
-   runtime:
    -   update legacy version compat table (needs to be adjusted for semver as coerce isn't available on older semver versions, or rather needs to be dep and node version specific rather than clumped together)
    -   have npm scripts use `rm -rf` instead of `rm -Rf` for greater compat
    -   **if targeting old node versions, have prettier enforce es5 comma mode, otherwise native javascript editions and the editions autoload will break compat**

## v1.82.1 2023 November 4

-   Better error message when all ESM editions fail

## v1.82.0 2023 November 4

-   Support empty directories (fixed missing engines error)
-   Fix engines not being updated for websites and `desiredNodeOnly` projects
-   Repeat spawns that failed due to connection errors
-   Skip `organisation` property if it could be defaulted (it is inferred from github slug, which is inferred from git url)

## v1.81.0 2023 November 3

-   Boundation now uses the default branch where appropriate instead of always using `master`, if could not be determined, fallbacks to the git config, then the global git config, then `main`

## v1.80.0 2023 November 2

-   Improved core:
    -   No longer uses `node-fetch`, instead uses the Node.js fetch builtin
-   Improved questions:
    -   New `maintainedNodeVersions`, `expandNodeVersions`, `shrinkNodeVersions` questions
        -   These replace the oldschool `lts` question, that was removed ages ago.
    -   TypeScript no longer has targets it doesn't support
    -   Ensure that `nodeVersionsSupported` and `nodeVersionsTested` are constrained to their minimum and maximum
    -   Corrected the description of `nodeVersionsTested` as it is not (by default) an automated property
-   Improved CI:
    -   Don't test Node.js versions before 16 on GitHub Actions, as they will be ignored as [they are no longer supported on GitHub Actions](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-13-github-actions-all-actions-will-run-on-node16-instead-of-node12-by-default/)
    -   Verify the Node.js and NPM versions on GitHub Actions
    -   Update the versions of the GitHub Actions
    -   Resolved `make-deno-edition` failing on GitHub ACtions
        -   Deno is setup on GitHub Actions if the project uses Deno (determined by `deno` keyword)
-   Improved runtime:
    -   Resolved an issue with aggressive Node.js engine changes:
        -   The `package.json:engines:node` is no longer always updated to the supported or desired version beforehand, now it is only updated once we know what Node.js versions we target
    -   `package.json:scripts:our:compile:deno` is only added if the project uses Deno (determined by `deno` keyword)
-   Improved versions:
    -   Boundation is much more intelligent and helpful when it comes to expanding or shrinking the editions and Node.js engine support as necessary.

-   This work was done in November 2021, however life circumstances mean it is only released now
-   Updated dependencies

## v1.69.3 2020 November 3

-   Fix where errors are written (regression since v1.69.2)

## v1.69.2 2020 November 3

-   Use [@bevry/ansi](https://github.com/bevry/ansi) for colors and styles

## v1.69.1 2020 November 3

-   Extracted out some utilities into [@bevry/list](https://github.com/bevry/list), [arrange-package-json](https://github.com/bevry/arrange-package-json), and [@bevry/github-orgs](https://github.com/bevry/github-orgs)

## v1.69.0 2020 October 29

-   Node version handling improvements have continued even further
    -   Historical versions are only kept if they were LTS versions (no more v11, v13)
    -   TypeScript Targets are now determined accurately, with only the necessary ones automatically determined
    -   You can now specify a `nodeVersionTestedRange` to limit the testing versions
    -   The failed and tolerated versions are now correctly determined
    -   Node v0.8 is now recognised again
    -   Node versions are intelligently upgraded if everything is streamlined, but if the engines are custom, then they are kept and expanded if more are indeed available
    -   `desiredNodeOnly` works with the upgrade flow once more
-   Updated dependencies, [base files](https://github.com/bevry/base), and [editions](https://editions.bevry.me) using [boundation](https://github.com/bevry/boundation)

## v1.68.0 2020 October 27

-   Node version handling improvements have continued, now rather than presenting ranges, it will present versions
-   The versions are filtered accordingly to the requirements of your environment and your preferences
-   Initially supported versions are limited to the specified node engine
-   If testing results in additionally supported versions, they will be added as supported
-   The issue from v1.67.0 of dev versions being kept is now resolved
-   Updated dependencies, [base files](https://github.com/bevry/base), and [editions](https://editions.bevry.me) using [boundation](https://github.com/bevry/boundation)

## v1.67.0 2020 October 26

-   Fixed compatibility with latest nvm versions
-   Improved forward compatibility with latest node versions
-   Improved compatibility with zeit/now to vercel rename
-   Updated dependencies, [base files](https://github.com/bevry/base), and [editions](https://editions.bevry.me) using [boundation](https://github.com/bevry/boundation)

## v1.66.3 2020 September 4

-   Fix regression from v1.66.0 where compilers other than `babel` and `typescript` would fail on targets question

## v1.66.2 2020 September 4

-   Fix regression from v1.66.0 where for javascript projects that compile for web browsers, both the source edition and browser edition would target web browsers
    -   Instead, if one is electing to compile for web browsers, then don't mark the source edition as well as compatible for browsers
-   Source editions now have the `source` tag added, and compiled editions now have the `compiled` tag added

## v1.66.1 2020 September 4

-   When boundation fails, it will now fail with a failure exit code

## v1.66.0 2020 September 4

-   Boundation now treats ESM seriously when ESM is desired
    -   Before boundation would just generate an ESNext edition for ESM targets, and hope for compatibility, which often would not actually be the case during consumer runtime
    -   Now boundation will generate multiple appropriate ESM editions, test each one against the targeted environments, then keep the edition that is most supported, and will error if ESM support could not be provided for an intended target environment
-   When targetting modern environments, only the TypeScript targets necessary will be generated, with superflous ones skipped
-   You can now select whether or not you want to generate only CJS, only ESM, or both
-   For DocPad Plugins, ensure that `peerDependencies.docpad` is set correctly
-   Updated dependencies

-   Add [Mergify](https://mergify.io) configuration to auto-merge dependabot pull requests
-   Updated dependencies

## v1.65.5 2020 August 17

-   For DocPad Plugins, add `our:setup:dpt` script to install test dependencies
-   For `docpad-plugintester` ensure `editions` dependency remains installed
-   For TypeScript projects, specify the `tsconfig.json:targets` as what was specified in the Q&A
-   Updated dependencies

## v1.65.4 2020 August 6

-   Fix support of `--lts` argument
-   Revised compatibility with [DocPad](https://github.com/docpad/docpad) ecosystem
    -   src -> source
    -   prettier should ignore test folder as makes comparisons harder if prettier is running on expected output
    -   docpad should install docpad-baseplugin
    -   docpad plugins should install baseplugin and plugintester and set their test script to the plugin tester
    -   docpad plugin tester uses kava and assert helpers
    -   docpad-plugin-babel uses some babel packages
    -   use npx when testing docpad plugins, otherwise plugin tester is not found
    -   run docpad ecosystem projects in serial mode when testing edition compatibility
-   Fix `SyntaxError: The requested module 'typechecker' does not provide an export named 'default'`
    -   Thanks to [Thomas Reggi](https://github.com/reggi) and [Sumit Rai](https://github.com/sumitrai) for [issue #72](https://github.com/bevry/boundation/issues/72)
-   Updated dependencies, [base files](https://github.com/bevry/base), and [editions](https://editions.bevry.me) using [boundation](https://github.com/bevry/boundation)

## v1.65.3 2020 July 22

-   fixed fetching the default entry filename (regression since v1.62.0)
-   Updated dependencies, [base files](https://github.com/bevry/base), and [editions](https://editions.bevry.me) using [boundation](https://github.com/bevry/boundation)

## v1.65.2 2020 July 22

-   fixed automated dependencies being saved as dev dependencies, and automated dev dependencies not being updated (regression since v1.64.0)
-   Updated dependencies, [base files](https://github.com/bevry/base), and [editions](https://editions.bevry.me) using [boundation](https://github.com/bevry/boundation)

## v1.65.1 2020 July 22

-   delete the `package.json:type` when we cannot determine what it should be
-   correct handling of mjs, cjs, and js files
-   fix application of `bin` permissions
-   Updated dependencies, [base files](https://github.com/bevry/base), and [editions](https://editions.bevry.me) using [boundation](https://github.com/bevry/boundation)

## v1.65.0 2020 July 3

-   move from `.cjs` and `.mjs` index files, to [`package.json:exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_conditional_exports)
    -   if compiled-types exists, use that for the type information in the auto-loader
-   package manager default changed from `yarn` back to `npm` - npm was swapped to yarn in v1.63.0

## v1.64.0 2020 June 26

-   boundation is now coded in ESM instead of CJS
-   exact dependencies are now changed to the `^` range
    -   this can overidden by specifying any exact versions inside `package.json:boundation.versions`
-   now we generate ESM editions for node.js, and do the `cjs` and `mjs` magic
    -   this is because esm modules compiled to cjs do not do `export default` but `export { default }` so a compatibility layer is necessary, such as precompiler magic, or generating an esm edition
        -   See [typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/5565#issuecomment-155216760) and [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/2212) for their lack of support for `export default`

## v1.63.6 2020 June 25

-   actually set correct bin permissions for bin objects too

## v1.63.5 2020 June 25

-   set correct bin permissions for bin objects too

## v1.63.4 2020 June 25

-   prepare and use global install of `npm-check-updates` as it is much faster than going via npx
-   ensure that the bin path has executable permissions, which is required for yarn environments
-   dev change: ensure all local imports have file extension to make lookups quicker

## v1.63.3 2020 June 25

-   yarn still needs ncu to update `package.json`

## v1.63.2 2020 June 25

-   don't do `prefer-offline` as it causes inconsistent dependency versions (at least with yarn)
-   move removing old files from runtime to base, to increase performance

## v1.63.1 2020 June 25

-   remove yarn configuration files if we use npm
-   if using yarn, run `yarn upgrade`
-   run `our:setup` after all deps are sorted

## v1.63.0 2020 June 25

-   purge package manager files at start
-   better support for yarn and npm switching
-   auto default to yarn, as it is more stable
    -   this can be overwritten using boundation config
-   remove `upgradeAllDependencies`
    -   you can enforce particular dependency verisons using boundation config
-   check for dependencies that exist in both deps and devDeps, and trigger repair for this corrupted state
    -   repair will restore deps from a previous version
-   remove minami on jsdoc projects, no longer preferred
-   for yarn and npm, only uninstall installed deps to save time
    -   before this was done only for npm
-   prefer quick installs (prfer-offline, no-fund, no-audit)
-   remove support for yarn pnp, as support has changed
-   add support for preventing use of busted package versions
    -   currently required code updates, maybe one day this can be configurable

## v1.62.1 2020 June 20

-   Don't use `package.json[entry]` fields to prefill entries, as it doesn't allow auto-detection when entries change - if you wish for a fixed entry, use `package.json:boundation[whateverEntry]`

## v1.62.0 2020 June 20

-   If a file exists within the source edition of the name `node`, `deno`, or `browser` it will be selected as the entry for the appropriate edition
-   If there is only one valid node edition, then `package.json:main` will point to the node entry
-   Renamed `mainEntry` to `indexEntry` to serve more like a default in case there is conflicts
-   This allows greater support for cross-runtime packages, as custom entries can be provided for the different runtimes

## v1.61.0 2020 June 20

-   Updated dependencies, [base files](https://github.com/bevry/base), and [editions](https://editions.bevry.me) using [boundation](https://github.com/bevry/boundation)

## v1.18.0 2018 August 19

Edition engines are now the range of unique supported versions for that edition, and are trimmed and passed accordingly.

For instance, say `edition:esnext` supports node 6, 8, 10 and `edition:node:0.8` only node 0.10, 0.12, 4.
You wouldn't want `edition:node:0.8` to run against node 6, 8, 10 via an engine of `>0.10`.
As such, targeted editions now have their engines set to the specific node versions they support.
So for this example, `edition:node:0.8` would have the engines `0.10 || 0.12 || 4` instead of `>0.10`.

This can be seen from the following log output:

```text
